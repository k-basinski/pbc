# Nociception

---

# Nociception

*  Activation of pain receptors (nociceptors)
*  Activation of pain pathways
*  A specific pattern of nociception leads to the sensation of pain

---

# Nociception

*  Nociceptors - receptors in skin, muscles, joints etc.
*  Two types of fibers carry information from nociceptors:
    * AÎ´ - myelinated - rapid transmission
    * C - not myelinated - slower transmission (_second pain_)
*  These end in the dorsal horn

---

# Nociceptors

*  Some nociceptors respond to specific type of stimulation, eg. heat, pressure, chemical burns.
*  Nociceptors differ in terms of activation threshold - some "quiet" receptors need more stimulation than others

---

# Nociceptors

*  Sensitization (not habituation) of C fibers due to prolonged stimulation
*  If stimulation is long enough, more distant nociceptors become active
*  Nociception may last longer than pain stimulation itself

# Gate control theory (Melzack, Wall)

![Gate closed](img/01_gate_closed.png)

---

# Gate control theory (Melzack, Wall)

*  Extentions of gate control theory state that the gate might be regulated centrally
*  Unclear mechanism but some cognitive processes are implicated

---

# Pain pathway

![Pathway](img/01_pathway.jpg)

---

# Brain regions _involved_ in pain processing

* Cerebellum (Cb)
* Thalamus (Thal)
* Insula (Ins)
* Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
* Primary somatosensory cortex (SI)
* Secondary somatosensory cortex (SII)
* Supplementary motor area (SMA)

# Pain modulation


* Pain modulation - change in pain (analgesia or hyperalgesia) as a result of other processes, also cognitive
* Descending Pain Modulation System (DPMS)
* Periaqueductial grey matter (PAG)
* Slightly different emotional and cognitive traces of modulation

---

# Emotional / affective modulation

* Positive affect **decreses pain**
* Negative affect **increses pain**
* ...but not always (stress-induced analgesia)
* Limbic system involved (yeah...)
* Pain vs. depression conundrum

---

# Cognitive modulation

* Concentrating on pain **increases** pain
* Distraction **decreases** pain
* Placebo effect
* Nocebo effect
