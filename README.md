## COVID-19 notice

Since the school is on lockdown, we are going to change the way our course proceeds. 

1. Right now I’m in the process of recording videos for the stuff that we were going to talk about. There will be links on the course website to those videos, please check them out.
2. To receive credit, you need to make a presentation in groups. Nothing’s changed here, you have topics chosen. The lockdown is in place until 25th of March, so there is a chance that our last class will take place as scheduled on March 30th. You’ll make your presentations then.
3. If however the lockdown gets extended, I would like you to prepare your presentations and send them over to me remotely. You can do it in three ways. You can record a screencast similar to my videos and send it via email/youtube link. Else, you can prepare powerpoint slides with speaker notes attached. Finally, you can write an essay (about 2-3 pages) instead of a presentation. The choice is yours.
4. If the lockdown is extended, the final deadline for your presentations would be April 14th. 
5. Since you are to do this task in groups, I encourage you to work remotely (via communicators, chats, online docs etc). The best way to minimise COVID-19 threat is through social distancing. Don’t meet in groups unless you can avoid it. 
6. If there are any questions, don’t hesitate to ask me.
